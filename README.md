# Raspberry Pi OS from Scratch

*Experimentation with building operating systems for the Raspberry Pi from
scratch.*

## What's included

This repo contains experimentation and tinkering based on a guide written by
Jake Sandler ([jsandler18](https://github.com/jsandler18)) called
[Building an Operating System for the Raspberry Pi](https://jsandler18.github.io/).

Versions of a minimal implementation of an OS for several version of the
Raspberry Pi are included with associated build configuration and tooling.
Earlier versions of the Pi can be emulated with QEMU but later versions require
hardware to run.

### Raspberry Pi

The OG Raspberry Pi. Increasingly rare but I still have the one I preordered
many years ago.

### Raspberry Pi 2B

The 2B is supported by QEMU, which is used to run the OS since I don't have one.

### Raspberry Pi 3B

### Raspberry Pi 4B
